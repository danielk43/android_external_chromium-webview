Building the Chromium-based WebView in AOSP is no longer supported. WebView can
now be built entirely from the Chromium source code.

General instructions for building WebView from Chromium:
https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/build-instructions-android-webview

------

The prebuilt libwebviewchromium.so included in these APKs is built from Chromium
release tag 91.0.4472.158, using the GN build tool. To match Bromite build settings, set:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bromite/bromite/master/build/GN_ARGS

$$ depends on device ARCH
(00=arm, 50=arm64, 10=x86, 60=x64)

in your GN argument file before building.
